# Require that `process.exit()` expressions use the same code path as `throw` (`n/process-exit-as-throw`)

💼 This rule is enabled in the ✅ `recommended` [config](https://github.com/eslint-community/eslint-plugin-n#-configs).

## 📖 Rule Details

```js
function foo(a) {
    if (a) {
        return new Bar();
    } else {
        process.exit(1);
    }
}
```

ESLint does not address `process.exit()` as stop in code path analysis, then [consistent-return] rule will warn the above code.

If you turn this rule on, ESLint comes to address `process.exit()` as throw in code path analysis. So, above code will get expected code path.

This rule itself never warn code.
